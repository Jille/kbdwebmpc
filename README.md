kbdwebmpc is a keyboard-only webinterface [MPD](http://www.musicpd.org/)-client.

It was written for [Villa van Schaeck](http://github.com/villavanschaeck) and stripped down to a basic MPD-client. You'll probably find some weird code that was less weird before I stripped the location-specific parts.

If you have any questions feel free to contact us.
